// //a language using which , we can instruct the computer
//  to carry out real lifetasks and computation is called a 
//  programming language .it acts as a language in which we 
//  could easily express our thoughts to the machine.
// // like natural language , programming language has a
//  fixed set of rules according to which programs could be 
//  written in it. these programs are then converted into a 
//  language which machines can understand. this task is carried
//   out by a special software called compiler
// //EVERY LANGUAGE HAS ITS OWN COMPILER/INTERPRETOR.
// //SOME LANGUAGE USES COMPILER WHILE SOME USES INTERPRETOR.
// //once a program is compiled and linked , its executable 
// is created and the computer can run program now.
